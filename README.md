# My first data science project
This is my first independent try at doing something like data science within the Udacity course "Introduction to data science". Therefore is is not an example of how to best solve things but it shows how I stumble around getting my first bearings in the wide field of data science and learning how to do it.
## Installation
The project is set up as a Juypter notebook. In addition the [Seattle Airbnb Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) data set is needed and saved in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.

In addition the following packages need to be installed
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- seaborne

## Usage
Recommended usage: Whenever you are frustrated with your current data set and want to be reminded off how it was when you did your first steps.
## Licence
